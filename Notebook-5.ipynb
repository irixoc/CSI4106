    "***INTRODUCTION***:\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised classification task tackled in this notebook is to determine whether a passenger survived or did not survive on the Titanic. This is a common introductory problem to supervised machine learning and is a challenge on a popular site called Kaggle. Kaggle contains competitions that participants can compete in. These competitions typical provide a dataset to work with and a description of the problem to solve. That said, not all datasets will include the ground truth for the test set. Or, a competition may only provide a training and validation set, not the test set. This means that participants will not know how their models perform on the real unseen data until the host(s) test the participant's submission on the private test set, posting the results.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will expand your knowledge from the previous notebook and will introduce the concept of dealing with class imabalance through the use of a technique called oversampling. You will also see how a dataset can have issues with its data and that not every feature should be used to train and test a model. You will also perform the training, testing, and evaluation in slightly new ways since we will be working with a different type of dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, this notebook uses **scikit-learn** (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), **Matplot**, **Numpy**, and **Pandas**. Also, we will be using **imblearn** which provides robust techniques for balancing the number of instances of different classes. To install this packge, use the command ***pip install imbalanced-learn***. If this causes any issues you can also try *pip install imblearn*.  As was mentioned in the previous notebook, if a local installation of these packages creates any problem, don't hesitate to move to *colab*, an environment provided by Google in which you can run your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Logistic Regression algorithm to perform the binary classification of the survival of passengers on the Titanic. After evaluating both models, you will determine which performed better, and why. Finally, you will go through the process once more to determine whether or not a common oversampling technique will improve the results obtained.    "

    "One important note from the data above is that not every sample contains data for each column. For example, Passenger 6 (Moran, Mr. James) does not contain a value for their *Age* and does not contain the *Cabin* that they were residing in. Since Machine Learning algorithms learn from data, a Data Scientist will need to learn how to accurately fill in the missing data. Robust methods of doing this is beyond the scope of this notebook, but we will be filling in most of the missing data later on through simple means.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Another note is that it is important to consider whether one class is seen more frequently than another class within the data. A class with the most instances is called the *majority* class and a class with least instances is called the *minority* class. If one class contains more instances than another class, the algorithm may focus on learning that majority class more than the minority class. In problems such as cancer diagnosis, this is a major problem (since many more people do not have cancer). Thus, another issue that we will explore in this notebook is the concept of using oversampling  to balance the class distribution. This concept will be explained in detail later in the notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a plot of the number of instances for each class. In this scenario, based on the data available from the training set, more people did not survive on the Titanic than those who did survive (as we would expect in this scenario). Since we cannot simply collect more data on passenger's who survived the Titanic, we will need to think of ways to balance the class distribution."

In the 2 figures below, we see a slightly different distribution between men and women, related to age. In men, this distribution is relatively uniform (except for a peak around age 30), but for women, there is a greater proportion between age 18 and 30. The visualization helps to quickly get an idea of the attribute distributions."

    "1. The distribution represented by the histogram seems to show that both men and women paid a lower fare, with more men paying a lower fare in general. It seems that more men paid less, but this could be due to the fact that there were more male passengers, which created an unbalanced data set. However, this theory cannot be considered until the number of male and female passengers are counted, at the very least.\n",

One method is to simply take the minority class and, through some method, produce more instances of that class. For example, a trivial method could be to randomly select a number instances and duplicate them to match the number of instances from the majority class. This concept is called *oversampling*. You can also remove instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution (called *undersampling*).    \n",

    "The Logistic Regression model in Q9(c) performed noticeably better than the Logistic Regression model in Q8(b). However, the results were slightly mixed for the Naive Bayes model. When comparing the Naive Bayes Model in Q9(c)to the one in Q8(b), there were areas that performed negligibly worse, and areas that performed notably better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results that showed how the Logistic Regression model improved with the oversampled training data are the precision for class 0 and class 1, the recall for class 1, the accuracy, the micro-average precision, and the macro-average precison. All received notable improvements in their performance measures. However, the recall value for class 0 was the only performance measure that seemed to do slightly worse, dropping from 0.91 to approximately 0.88. It is interesting to note that all the performance measures for the Logistic Regression model in Q9(c) seemed to be more consistent with each other, all their values fell within the range of 0.8 to 0.89. Thus, I believe that it is fair to conclude that oversampling helped to improve the Linear Regression model based on all the evidence presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results that demonstrated how the Naive Bayes model performed slightly worse with the oversampled training data are the recall for class 0, the accuracy, and the micro-average precision. All of these performance measures had negligible decreases that were less than approximately 1%. The precision for class 0 saw the largest decrease in performance, which was approximately a 6% reduction. Areas of improvement with the oversampled data were seen in the recall value for class 1 (approximately 6%), precision for for class 1 (approximately 10%), and a negligible improvement for the macro-average precision (which was approximately 2%). To conclude my evaluation, I beleive that oversampling also helped to improve the Naive Bayes model. Although there were some decreases in performance metrics for certain areas, the majority of those decreases were neglible, but there were almost just as many increases in other areas that were more significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I can conclude for this scenario that oversampling helps the Machine Learning process learn better because of the improvements that occurred based on our two models."
